## Features

* **Automated Imaging Analysis**: Uses Google Gemini AI ("gemini-2.0-flash") for detailed radiological interpretation.
* **DuckDuckGo Research**: Integrates a search tool to fetch recent literature and treatment protocols.
* **Structured Reporting**:

  * Modality & region identification
  * Key findings with measurements
  * Diagnostic assessment & differential diagnoses
  * Patient-friendly explanation
  * Research context with references
* **Interactive UI**: Simple Streamlit interface for image upload and result display.
* **Environment-Driven**: API key loaded from environment variable; no hard-coded secrets.
* **Optimized Performance**: Cached agent initialization, efficient image resizing, and temporary file management.

---

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* A valid Google API key with access to the Gemini model
* `pip` package manager

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Genious07/medicalagent.git
   cd medical-imaging-agent
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Configuration

1. **Environment Variable**

   * Set your Google API key in the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable before running:

     ```bash
     export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_real_api_key_here"   # macOS/Linux
     set GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_real_api_key_here"      # Windows
     ```

2. **Supported Image Formats**

   * JPG, JPEG, PNG, DICOM

---

## Usage

1. **Start the app**

   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. **Open the UI**

   * By default, Streamlit opens at `http://localhost:8501`.

3. **Workflow in the UI**

   1. Upload your medical image.
   2. Click **üîç Analyze Image**.
   3. Await AI analysis‚Äîresults will appear with headers:

      * Image Type & Region
      * Key Findings
      * Diagnostic Assessment
      * Patient-Friendly Explanation
      * Research Context

## Project Structure

medical-imaging-agent/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py              # Streamlit application code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # Project documentation (this file)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore           # Excluded files and folders
```

## Cache & Performance

* **@st.cache\_resource** is used to persist the `Agent` across reruns, reducing API initialization overhead.
* **PILImage.thumbnail** with the `LANCZOS` filter ensures fast, high-quality image resizing.
* Temporary image files are managed via Python‚Äôs `tempfile` for safe cleanup.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Missing API Key**: The app will display an error if `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is unset. Ensure you‚Äôve exported it in your shell.
* **Unsupported File**: Verify your upload format (JPG, PNG, or DICOM).
* **Analysis Errors**: Exceptions from the AI agent will surface in the UI‚Äîcheck logs for stack traces.
* **Slow Performance**: Large image files may take longer. Pre-rescale externally if needed.
